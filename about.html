        <p id="past">CJ & the Boys began with a group of friends who wanted to make music together and share this music with the world. All 6 original members attended Chippewa Falls Senior High and graduated in 
            2017 (2), 2018 (3), and 2019 (1). Originally, they formed the brass band because they wanted to compete in the school talent show. They were inspired by band such as New York-based brass band 
            <a href="https://www.luckychops.com/" target = "_blank">Lucky Chops</a> and the energetic <a href="https://www.youngbloodbrassband.com/" target="_blank">Youngblood Brass Band</a>. 
            After their success in the talent show, they decided to keep making music together, and they
            gradually acquired more gigs and recognition. Over the years, CJ & the Boys has performed at Oktoberfests, a wedding reception, UWEC Jazz Festivals, Chi-Hi talent shows, graduation parties, the Northern
            Wisconsin State Fair, charity talent shows, and more!
        </p>
        </br>
        <p id="present">Today, CJ & the Boys is scattered among three states: WI, MN, and WA. However, we still love to make music together! The Minnesota boys are close enough to come for performances in the 
            area, and we have plenty of musical friends who have subbed in when one of us can't make a gig. Whenever we are all home around the holiday times, we make it a point meet together and play through 
            music as a group, because that's the reason we started, after all! So we are still very much alive as a musical group!
        </p>
        </br> 
        <p id="future">Looking forward, CJ & the Boys still plans to play together whenever possible. We were planning on performing at the 2020 UWEC Jazz Festival, but the whole event got cancelled because of 
            pandemic concerns. We look forward to playing in the 2021 Jazz Festival, and we hope to continue to get better, play gigs, and give people a memorable performance! The future is bright for CJ & the Boys,
            and we want to thank you for whatever part you play in that.
