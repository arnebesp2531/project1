        <h2>Itemized Assignment Expectation Report</h2>
        <p>
            Your site must meet the following expectations:
            <ol>
                <li>You will create a website for a client of your choosing. Your client could be a family member, a business, a student group, a friend, an online community, and so on. The only restriction is that the client cannot be just you.
                    <ul>
                        <li>This website was created for the brass band "CJ & the Boys", in which I am a member. However, I am not the only member, as there are 6 original core members.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                    
                <li>Your site must include some sort of header.
                    <ul>
                        <li>This website contains a header at the top of each page. It contains the band name and a navigation bar.</li>
                        <li>This header also sets the theme colors for the site, and all other colors in the site are usually based off of these two colors.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Your site must contain at least five separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Home (index) -- introduces the viewer to the band and provides a concise mission statement of the band.</li>
                        <li>About -- expands on who we are as a band, introducing the individuals and providing history of the band as a whole.</li>
                        <li>Videos -- is full of many embedded YouTube videos of previous performances.</li>
                        <li>Photos -- contains various miscellaneous photos of CJ & the Boys with the intent of making the band more personable. (However, many of the URL's to the images that I had were mysteriously removed, so most photos are currently duplicates on the photos on other pages of the site.) </li>
                        <li>Contact -- shows the user an embedded facebook window to stay in contact with the band, and provides other means of getting in contact.</li>
                        <li>Booking -- provides a fillable form that asks for details regarding a requested gig from the band.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Your site must include some sort of navigation links.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The navbar at the top of each page contains navigation links to the other pages and shows which page you are currently on.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens. For instance, multicolumn layouts on large screens should be reduced to single column layouts on small screens. You are encouraged to implement separate layouts using CSS media queries.
                    <ul>
                        <li>________________</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Your site must maintain a coherent style across its pages. Global style rules must be placed in a shared stylesheet. Individual pages’ style rules must be placed in a separate stylesheets.
                    <ul>
                        <li>There is a global stylesheet.css that is applied to each page on the site.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>There are many images in this site, all of either the whole band or the members involved.</li>

                <li>Each page must declare its favicon.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each page on this site declares a custom-made favicon (which I made on <a href = "https://www.favicon.cc" target="_blank">https://www.favicon.cc</a>)</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Your site must not be built using any libraries or frameworks. Do not use Bootstrap, jQuery, React, Angular, Vue, or any other third-party tools. You may, however, reimplement the ideas you see in these third-party tools.
